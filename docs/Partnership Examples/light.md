# Light.so

[Light](https://light.so/) is a Metaverse Explorer, enabling users to discover connections that was not possible before.
With Light, users can discover mutual DAOs they have contributed with, gather around mutual NFT collections, and see past common POAP events that users have attended to.
Users can also see an aggregated profile of activity that is associated with the wallet, visualizing their identity in the metaverse.

Light.so is built on top of CyberConnect. CyberConnect provides address connections, recommendations through the CyberConnect Indexer API. Also, users can start to follow or unfollow someone through CyberConnect JavaScript SDK.
Together with CyberConnect, Light.so is increasingly gathering connections and building up a potential and prominent Metaverse explorer!
